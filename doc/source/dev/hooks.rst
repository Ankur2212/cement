Framework and Application Hooks
===============================

Hooks allow the developers to tie into different pieces of the application.
A hook can be defined anywhere, be it internally in the application, or in a
plugin.  Once a hook is defined, functions can be registered to that hook so
that when the hook is called, all functions registered to that hook will be 
run.  By defining a hook, you are saying that you are going to honor that hook
somewhere in your application.  Using descriptive hook names are good for
clarity.  For example, 'pre_database_connect_hook' is obviously a hook that
will be run before a database connection is attempted.
    
The most important thing to remember when defining hooks for your application
is to properly document them.  Include whether anything is expected in return
or what, if any, arguments will be passed to the hook functions when called.

Defining a Hook
---------------

A hook can be defined as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement2.core import foundation, hook
    
    # First create the application
    app = foundation.lay_cement('myapp')
    
    # Then define any application hooks
    hook.define('my_example_hook')

    # Setup the application
    app.setup()
    

Hooks should be defined as early on in the bootstrap process as possible,
after 'lay_cement()' is called.            


Registering Functions to a Hook
-------------------------------

A hook is just an identifier, but the functions registered to that hook are 
what get run when the hook is called.  Registering a hook function should also 
be done early on in the bootstrap process (before the hook is called 
obviously).  

.. code-block:: python

    from cement2.core import foundation, hook
    
    # First create the application
    app = foundation.lay_cement('myapp')
    
    # Then define any application hooks
    hook.define('my_example_hook')

    # Register any hook functions.  In the real world, this would likely be
    # done elsewhere in the application such as in plugins.
    @hook.register()
    def my_example_hook():
        # do something
        something = "The result of my hook."
        return something
    
    @hook.register(name='my_example_hook')
    def my_function_with_some_other_name():
        # do something
        pass
        
    # Setup the application
    app.setup()
    
    
    
The @hook.register() decorator uses the name of the function you are 
decorating to determine the hook you are registering for, or you can pass the
name parameter.  Note that if combining with other decorators you must pass
the name parameter.

What you return depends on what the developer defining the hook is expecting.
Each hook is different, and the nature of the hook determines whether you need
to return anything or not.  That is up to the developer.  Also, the args and
kwargs coming in depend on the developer.  You have to be familiar with 
the purpose of the defined hook in order to know whether you are receiving any
args or kwargs.

Registering a hook just puts the function into the hook list.  This will be an
unbound function, so if you register a function that is a class method keep in
mind that 'self' doesn't exist in the context of when the hook is run.  For the
most part, standard unbound functions are best for hooks rather than controller
or other class methods.


Running a hook
--------------

Now that a hook is defined, and functions have been registered to that hook
all that is left is to run it.  Keep in mind, you don't want to run a hook
until after the application load process... meaning, after all plugins and 
other code are loaded.  If you receive an error that the hook doesn't exist,
then you are trying to register a hook to soon before the hook is defined.

.. code-block:: python

    from cement2.core import hook
    
    for res in hook.run('my_example_hook'):
        # do something with res?
        pass
        
As you can see we iterate over the hook, rather than just calling 
'hook.run()'.  This is necessary because hook.run() yields the results from
each hook.  Hooks can be run anywhere *after* the hook is defined, and hooks
are registered to that hook.


Controlling Hook Run Order
--------------------------

Sometimes you might have a very specific purpose in mind for a hook, and need
it to run before or after other functions in the same hook.  For that reason
there is an optional 'weight' parameter that can be passed when registering a
hook function.  

The following is an example application that defines, registers, and runs
a custom application hook:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement2.core import backend, foundation, controller, handler, hook

    # create an application
    app = foundation.lay_cement('myapp')

    # define a hook
    hook.define('myapp_default_command_hook')

    # define an application base controller
    class MyAppBaseController(controller.CementBaseController):
        class meta:
            interface = controller.IController
            label = 'base'
            description = "My Application does amazing things!"

            defaults = {}
            arguments = []
        
        @controller.expose(hide=True, aliases=['run'])
        def default(self):
            for res in hook.run('myapp_default_command_hook', self.app):
                pass

    handler.register(MyAppBaseController)

    # setup the application
    app.setup()

    # register some hooks

    @hook.register(name='myapp_default_command_hook', weight=0)
    def hook1(app):
        print 'Inside hook1 of %s.' % app.name
    
    @hook.register(name='myapp_default_command_hook', weight=100)
    def hook2(app):
        print 'Inside hook2 of %s.' % app.name

    @hook.register(name='myapp_default_command_hook', weight=-99)
    def hook3(app):
        print 'Inside hook3 of %s.' % app.name
    
    # run the application
    app.run()

And the result is:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python test.py
    Inside hook3 of myapp.
    Inside hook1 of myapp.
    Inside hook2 of myapp.
    
    
As you can see, it doesnâ€™t matter what order we register the hook, the 
weight runs then in order from lowest to highest.  

Cement Framework Hooks
----------------------

Cement has a number of hooks that tie into the framework.

cement_setup_hook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
Run when CementApp.setup() is called.  No arguments are passed to this hook, 
and nothing is expected in return.

.. code-block:: python

    from cement2.core import hook
    
    @hook.register(name='cement_setup_hook')
    def my_setup_hook():
        # do something on application setup()
        pass
        

cement_add_args_hook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Called after the 'argument' handler is setup.  The application configuration
object is passed as the first argument, and the argument handler object is 
passed as the second argument to each hook that is called.  Nothing is 
expected in return.

.. code-block:: python

    from cement2.core import hook
    
    @hook.register(name='cement_add_args_hook')
    def my_args_hook(config, args):
        # do something with config and/or args objects
        args.add_argument('-f', '--foo', dest='foo', action='store_true')

Note: This hook is useful for framework extensions to be able to add options
to the argument handler.  


cement_validate_config_hook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Called after the application is fully setup.  The application 'config' handler
object is passed as the first argument.  It does not expect anything in 
return.
        
.. code-block:: python

    from cement2.core import hook
    
    @hook.register(name='cement_validate_config_hook')
    def my_config_hook(config):
        # do something to validate the config
        if not config.has_key('base', 'foo'):
            raise MyAppConfigError, "Required configuration 'foo' missing."
