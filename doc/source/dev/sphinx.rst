Documenting Your Application
============================

As of Cement 0.8.17, all pasted applications come with built in Sphinx 
documentation.  All documentation is standard with regard to Sphinx, and 
therefore we don't cover how to document things here.  For more information
please visit the `Sphinx Documentation <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.

Generating the Docs
-------------------

To build Sphinx documentation, you need to have the 'sphinx' package installed.
Then run the following:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python setup.py build_sphinx
