Cement CLI Application Framework v2
===================================

Cement2 is an advanced CLI Application Framework for Python, and a complete
rewrite of Cement version 0.x/1.x.  Its goal is to introduce a standard, and 
feature-full platform for both simple and complex command line applications as 
well as support rapid development needs without sacrificing quality.

Please note that currently Cement2 is under development out of the 'portland' 
branch on GitHub, and is being released as beta until 2.0.0 stable is 
released.
