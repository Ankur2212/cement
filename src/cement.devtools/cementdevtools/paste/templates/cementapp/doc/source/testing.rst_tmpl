{{project.capitalize()}} uses the Nose testing platform, and can be enabled by
uncommenting the following lines from setup.py:

.. code-block:: text

    setup_requires=[
        ### Uncomment for nose testing + coverage
        "nose",
        # "coverage",
        ],


To run the tests, simply execute the following:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python setup.py nosetests
    

Accessing Coverage Reports
--------------------------

Coverage can be enabled by uncommenting it in setup.py:

.. code-block:: text

    setup_requires=[
        ### Uncomment for nose testing + coverage
        "nose",
        "coverage",
        ],


When running tests, a coverage report will display after completion.  You can
also generate HTML reports by executing the following:

The reports will be created at **./htmlcov**.
