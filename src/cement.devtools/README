DESCRIPTION:

Cement is an advanced CLI Application Framework for Python. The 'devtools' 
package provides tools and libraries needed for developing applications that
are built on Cement.

The Cement CLI Application Framework is Open Source and is distributed under 
The MIT License.  


GETTING STARTED:

Stable versions of Cement can be installed via the cheeze shop:
::
    $ easy_install cement
    
    $ easy_install cement.devtools


Development versions of Cement can be checked out of Git:
::
    $ git clone git://github.com/derks/cement.git


With the 'devtools' package, Cement applications, and plugins can be 
created via PasteScript. Once cement.core and cement.devtools are installed, 
the following command will create a command line application built on top of 
the Cement Framework:
::
    $ paster cement-app myapp


The following command will create an external plugin for your application:
::
    $ paster cement-plugin myapp myplugin
