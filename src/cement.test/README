NAME: cement-test

AUTHOR: BJ Dierkes <wdierkes@5dollarwhitebox.org>

DESCRIPTION:

The Cement Test application was created to facilitate proper testing of the
Cement CLI Application Framework.  Most of the features in Cement rely on
a loaded application to be access them, making testing a bit more 
complex than simply running nose on the cement module.  

The Cement Test application is simply a generic/useless application created
via the cement.devtools paster template, with a few added lines of code to
reach more of the framework and assist in testing coverage.  The primary
use of cement-test is for the nose tests in ./tests.

The Cement Test application is Open Source and is distributed under 
The MIT License.  


USAGE:

From within the cement.test source directory execute:

    $ nosetests --verbosity 3 


If testing for coverage run:

    $ coverage run /path/to/nosetests && coverage html
    
    
CONFIGURATION:

The application is configured to only read './config/cement-test.conf'.
