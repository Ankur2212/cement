DESCRIPTION:

Describe your application here.

cementtest is built on the Cement CLI Application Framework.


USAGE:

    $ cementtest --help
    
    
CONFIGURATION:

Application configuration files are parsed in the following order:

    * /etc/cementtest/cementtest.conf
    * ~/.cementtest.conf

    
PLUGIN DEVELOPMENT:

cementtest supports external plugins via the Cement Framework.  To quick
start a new plugin for cementtest you can use the paster utility.

Setup a virtual environment for development:
    
    $ virtualenv --no-site-package /path/to/env
    
    $ source /path/to/env/bin/activate
    
    
Install cementtest:
    
    $ cd /path/to/cementtest
    
    $ python setup.py develop
    

Create and install the plugin:

    $ mkdir plugins
    
    $ cd plugins
    
    $ paster cement-plugin cementtest myplugin
    
    $ cd cementtest.myplugin
    
    $ python setup.py develop
    
    
Once your plugin is installed, you can enable it by adding a [plugin] block
to a plugin config in /etc/cementtest/plugins.d/myplugin.conf. You should 
then see some example commands/options show up with:

    $ cementtest --help
    
    
Then, code away!
