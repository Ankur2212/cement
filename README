DESCRIPTION:

Cement is an advanced CLI Application Framework for Python. It promotes code
re-use by way of a plugin system that enables plugins to be shared between any 
application built on Cement.  The MVC and overall framework design is very 
much inspired by the TurboGears2 web framework.  Its goal is to introduce a 
standard, and feature-full platform for both simple and complex command line
applications as well as support rapid development needs without sacrificing
quality.

At a minimum, Cement configures the following features for every application:
::
     * Multiple Configuration file parsing (default: /etc, ~/)
     * Command line argument and option parsing
     * Dual Console/File Logging Support
     * Internal and External (3rd Party) Plugin support
     * Basic "hook" support
     * Model/View/Controller support for advanced application design
     * Text output rendering with Genshi templates
     * Json output rendering allows other programs to access your CLI-API
    

The above provides any level developer with a solid, and fully functional 
cli application from the very start with more or less a single command via 
the paster utility.  Cement brings an end to the 'hack it out, and [maybe] 
clean it up later' routine that we all find ourselves in under deadlines.

Any application can utilize existing plugins from The Rosendale Project, or 
from other 3rd party resources to extend functionality.  The plugin system is 
designed to allow portability of re-usable code, and it is encouraged to 
contribute any plugins back to the project to extend the functionality of 
Cement.

GETTING STARTED:

Stable versions of Cement can be installed via the cheeze shop:
::
    $ easy_install cement
    
    # If creating an application
    $ easy_install cement.devtools


Development versions of Cement can be checked out of Git:
::
    $ git clone git://github.com/derks/cement.git

    $ cd cement

    $ python setup.py install
    
    $ git clone git://github.com/derks/cement.devtools.git
    
    $ cd cement.devtools

    $ python setup.py install


With the 'devtools' package, Cement applications, and plugins can be 
created via PasteScript. Once cement and cement.devtools are installed, 
the following command will create a command line application built on top of 
the Cement Framework:
::
    $ paster cement-app myapp


The following command will create an external plugin for your application:
::
    $ paster cement-plugin myapp myplugin


Have an external helper library you want to make plugable?
::
    $ paster cement-helper myapp myhelper
