NAME: Cement

CREATOR/MAINTAINER: BJ Dierkes <wdierkes@5dollarwhitebox.org>

DESCRIPTION:

Cement is a CLI Application Framework for Python. It promotes code re-use by 
way of plugins and helper libraries that can be maintained internally, or 
shared with the community.  The MVC and overall framework design is very much
inspired by the TurboGears2 web framework.  

At a minimum, Cement easily sets up the following:

    Configuration file parsing [using ConfigObj]
    Command line arguments and option parsing [using OptParse]
    Logging [using Logger]
    Plugin support [partially using setuptools]
    Basic "hook" support
    Full MVC support for advanced application design
    Text output rendering with Genshi templates
    

These pieces are important for any command line application.. 
Normally to accomplish what's listed above would require hundreds of lines of 
code before you even begin working on your application logic. With Cement, the 
above is configured with more or less a single command (via paste).

Cement is most generally used as a starting point from which to begin 
developing a command line type application. That said, applications using 
cement can also share plugins with either cement or other applications using 
cement.

The Cement CLI Application Framework for Python is Open Source and is 
distributed under the Python Software Foundation License.


GETTING STARTED:

Stable versions of Cement can be installed via the cheeze shop:

    $ easy_install Cement
    
    $ easy_install CementPlugins


Development versions of Cement can be checked out of Git:

    $ git clone git://github.com/derks/cement.git
    
    $ cd cement
    
    $ python setup.py install
    
    
Additionally, Cement applications, plugins, and helpers can be created via 
PasteScript. Once Cement is installed, the following command will create a 
command line application built on top of the Cement Framework:

    $ paster cement-app <myapp>


The following command will create an external plugin for your application:

    $ paster cement-plugin <myapp> <myplugin>


Have a helper library you want to make plugable?

    $ paster cement-helper <myapp> <myhelper>
