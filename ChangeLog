0.7.1 - unreleased
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 +  Branching to portland, API incompatible changes.
 +  Namespace config dictionaries are overwritten by [namespace] section of
    primary applications configuration files.  Meaning, a namespace called
    'example' reads configurations from [example] in the applications config
    files.  Note: the [namespace] section is required.
 +  Added new 'bootstrap' directory where all application setup happens for 
    each namespace.
 
0.6.1 - unreleased
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 +  Set statedir (all data) to ~/<app_name> rather than ./var/etc.  Only 
    affects new apps (or apps without a config file).
 +  Added an additional config file location of <statedir>/etc/<app>.conf
 +  Added a -dev config file that is more suitable for development use.
 
0.6 - Feb 05, 2010
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 +  Version 0.6 Stable Release.
 
 
0.5.4 - unreleased 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

 +  Moving to the MIT License.
 +  Added full API and Developer documentation under ./doc


0.5.1 - Jan 2010
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

 +  Reworked cement to provide a proper model, view, controller interface
    very similar to the layout of TurboGears2.
 +  Added Genshi text templating support.
 +  Modified all paster templates to utilize new features.
 +  Added more debug output to Cement framework.
 +  Added pre_plugins_hook, and post_plugins_hook
 +  Added --debug, --json, and --quiet hard coded global options, which 
    function to alter output. The --quiet option removes sys.stdout 
    completely.
 +  Added Json output rendering, turns every app into a CLI-API
 +  The --json/--quiet options now buffer sys.stdout, and sys.stderror and 
    passes them on to json output should they be needed.  This eliminates the 
    ability for rouge output to interfere with what should be just json 
    output.

Incompatible Changes:

 -  Cement API Version Change: 0.5-0.6:20100115.  Cement will remain 
    compatible with this version of the API through version 0.6 stable.
 -  Removed 'register_command()' decorator in favor of the new expose()
    controller decorator.  
 -  Namespace 'commands' member is no longer a dict of CementCommand objects,
    is now a simplified dict of dicts.
 -  Plugin configs now end in .config, no longer .plugin
 -  Boolean config options now only support true/false to limit confusion
