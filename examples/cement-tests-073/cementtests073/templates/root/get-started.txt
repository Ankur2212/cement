Welcome to ${config['app_name']}.

This application is built on Cement, and is ready to rock!  Out of the box you
already have:

{% for feature in features %}\
    * $feature
{% end %}\

If your config file is setup right, you should notice that your app is already 
loading an 'example' plugin.  Plugins are enabled by adding a plugin config
file in your plugin_config_dir (see cementtests073.conf).  The plugin config
must have a [<plugin_name>] section and under that section you must set the
following setting
    
    * enable_plugin=true
    
This will tell Cement to load that plugin.  You can also load plugins from
other projects built on Cement by also adding the following setting:

    * provider = someotherapp
    
Where 'someotherapp' is the package name of the application providing the 
plugin.

The included example plugin is a great starting point to learn how to build on 
top of the Cement Framework.  The following files and directories should be 
explored:
 
    * ./cementtests073/bootstrap/example.py
    * ./cementtests073/controllers/example.py
    * ./cementtests073/model/example.py
    * ./cementtests073/templates/example/


This command is defined in the RootController in: 

    cementtests073/controllers/root.py 
    

Additionally, the output of this command is rendered by the Genshi templating 
engine.  The template is at cementtests073/templates/root/get-started.txt.
You can find documentation here on the template syntax here:

    * $genshi_link
    
    
That said, you can also render the output of commands as JSON.  Don't believe
me? Just run it again with the --json flag. 

To make the included 'example' plugin a permanent part of your application you 
simply need to add the following to cementtests073/bootstrap/root.py:

    from cementtests073.bootstrap import example
    
    
That said, by following the example plugin you can easily create built in code
or additional plugins in the same fashion.

Go forth, and code!
