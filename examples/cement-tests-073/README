Describe your application here.

cement-tests-073 is built on the Cement CLI Application Framework.


USAGE:

    $ cementtests073 --help
    
    
CONFIGURATION:

Application configuration files are parsed in the following order:

    * /etc/cementtests073/cementtests073.conf
    * ~/.cementtests073.conf

    
PLUGIN DEVELOPMENT:

cement-tests-073 supports external plugins via the Cement Framework.  To quick
start a new plugin for cementtests073 you can use the paster utility.

Setup a virtual environment for development:
    
    $ virtualenv --no-site-package /path/to/env
    
    $ source /path/to/env/bin/activate
    
    
Install cement-tests-073:
    
    $ cd /path/to/cement-tests-073
    
    $ python setup.py develop
    

Create and install the plugin:

    $ mkdir plugins
    
    $ cd plugins
    
    $ paster cement-plugin cementtests073 myplugin
    
    $ cd cementtests073-plugins-myplugin
    
    $ python setup.py develop
    
    
Once your plugin is installed, you can add the plugin to the enabled_plugins
setting in /etc/cementtests073/cementtests073.conf (or the path to the config).  
Additionally, the plugin configurations can be set in 
/etc/cementtests073/plugins.d/myplugin.conf. You should then see some example 
commands/options show up with:

    $ cementtests073 --help
    
    
Then, code away!
